Project: Predicting Housing Prices using Machine Learning Model

Project Overview:
In this project, I have develop and evaluate the performance and the predictive power of a model trained on Housing Prices dataset from the StatLib repository.
I have done supervised learning  to do predictive analysis
During my project I understand the important tools needed to develop a powerful ML model.
My model will help  in predicting future housing prices.
We’ll validate it against our test dataset
Once we get a good fit, we will use this model to predict the monetary value of a house.
A model like this would be very valuable for a real state agent who could make use of the information provided on daily basis.

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:
Anaconda Navigator is needed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook
Python
NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
